The SVD of a matrix $A$ is the factorization of $A$ into the product of three matrices $A = UDV^T$,
where the columns of $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal and the matrix $D$ is diagonal with positive real entries.
This decomposition can also be written as

$$
A = \sum_{k=1}^{r} \sigma_k u_k v_k^T
$$

where the singular value $\sigma_k$ is the $k$-th element of $D$ arranged in decending order, and
$u_k$ and $v_k$ are the $k$-th columns of $U$ and $V$. The approximation of $A$ can thus be obtained as follows:

$$
\tilde{A} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sigma_k u_k v_k^T
$$

where $n (\le r)$ is the rank of the compressed matrix $\tilde{A}$. If $A$ contains pixels of an image,
$\tilde{A}$ is a compressed image using a reduced amount of memory. This is what is meant by image
compression via SVD.
