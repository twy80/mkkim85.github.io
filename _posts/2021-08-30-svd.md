## SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) of matrix $A$

The SVD of a matrix $A$ is the factorization of $A$ into the product of three matrices $A = UDV^T$,
where the columns of $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal and the matrix $D$ is diagonal with nonnegative real entries.
This decomposition can also be written as

${\displaystyle A = \sum_{k=1}^{r} \sigma_k u_k v_k^T}$
{: .text-center }

where $r$ is the rank of $A$, the singular value $\sigma_k$ is the $k$-th element of $D$ arranged in decending order, and
$u_k$ and $v_k$ are the $k$-th columns of $U$ and $V$.

## Reducing the rank of $A$ (approximation)

The approximation of $A$, the rank of which is reduced to $n (\le r)$, is obtained as follows:

${\displaystyle \tilde{A} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sigma_k u_k v_k^T}$
{: .text-center }

where $n (\le r)$ is the rank of the compressed matrix $\tilde{A}$.

## Image compression via SVD

If $A$ contains pixels of an image, $\tilde{A}$ is a compressed image using a reduced amount of memory. This is what is meant by image
compression via SVD.
